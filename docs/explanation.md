This library is a simple set of utilities to perform
the most common operations in PostgreSQL. 

The pgOperations module has utilities to manage any table. 
It does not avoid the need for SQL knowledge, but facilitates the
most common tasks. Maybe this module is suitable for beginners and
small projects. 

There are other well known more powerful libraries as 
<a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/" target="_blank"> SQLAlchemy</a>, or the 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/" target="_blank"> Django Models</a>.
These libraries use one Python class to represent each table and its relationship. 
Both can create the tables and relationships in PostgreSQL or other 
databases, only using the defined classes. Latter, you will not need to 
know SQL to perform queries.
