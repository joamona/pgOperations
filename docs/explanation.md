This library is a simple set of utilities to perform
the most common operations in PostgreSQL. 

The pgOperations module has utilities to manage any table, even with
a PostGIS geometry field. 

It does not avoid the need for SQL knowledge, but facilitates the
most common tasks. Maybe this module is suitable for beginners and
small projects.
