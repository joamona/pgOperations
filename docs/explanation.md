This library is a simple set of utilities to perform
the most common operations in PostgreSQL. 

The pgOperations module has utilities to manage any table. 
It does not avoid the need of SQL knowledge, but facilitates the
most common tasks. May be this module is suitable for beginners and
small projects. 

There are other wellknown more powerful libraries as 
<a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/" target="_blank"> SQLAlchemy</a>, or the 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/" target="_blank"> Django Models</a>.
This libraries use one Python class to represent each table and its relationship. 
Both are able to create the tables and relationships in PostgreSQL, or even in other 
databases, only using the defined classes. Latter you will not need to 
know SQL to perform queries.
