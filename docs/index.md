# Welcome to the pgOperations Python module documentation

This site contains the project documentation for the Python
`PgOperations` module. It is a simple lightweight Python module to perform the most 
common operations in `PostgreSQL` and `PostgGIS`, avoiding most of the SQL syntax.

This module class methods allow insert, delete, update, select, create 
and delete tables and databases. Also you will be able to know is a table exists, get the field names 
of a table, and manage counters for your applications. 

The  class methods use Python dictionaries to insert and update data.

This module requires Python 3 and [Psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/).
