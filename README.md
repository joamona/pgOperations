# Welcome to the pgOperations Python module

It is a simple lightweight Python module to perform the most 
common operations in `PostgreSQL` and `PostgGIS`, avoiding most of the SQL syntax.

This module class methods allow insert, delete, update, select, create 
and delete tables and databases. Also, you will be able to know is a table exists, get the field names 
of a table, and manage counters for your applications. 

The  class methods use Python dictionaries to insert and update data. **This library supposes all python dictionary keys match with the table field names**.

This module requires Python 3 and [Psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/).

Read the [documentation](https://joamona.github.io/pgOperations/) to know how to use `pgOperations`. In the tutorial you will find
how to install, and use the class methods. The reference contains the classes and methods
description.
